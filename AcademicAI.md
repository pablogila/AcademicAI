## Be Specific
ChatGPT is a tool that can be used to generate text. It relies on the given context to generate the next word. It is a very powerful tool that can be used as an assistant to get things explained, 

## Train the inputs
It will rarely give you what you want at first. It particularly excells if you ask it to review its previous output, checking for any possible mistakes, and then ask it to continue from there. It will often give you a more coherent response.




    juanjo:

    Básicamente ser muy específico

    Entrenar los inputs, porque al principio nunca te da lo que quieres

    Paciencia porque el tamaño de ventana es limitado y de momento Chatgpt tiene poca memoria (4092 bloques si no recuerdo mal)

    Y es útil para algunas cosas pero no es dios

    No te va a dar un paper, pero sí te quita síndrome de página en blanco

    Da ideas chulas, pero eres tú el que determina

    Escribe Código pero a veces con fallos

    Es herramienta para facilitar el trabajo, no para hacerlo

    Funciona muy bien también para escribir en inglés, mete expresiones nativas bastante bien
