# Benefits and Risks of AI tools for Scientific Research

**Last update: 2023/05/15**  

This is a quick overview about the benefits, the risks and the how-to-s of AI tools for scientific research, and in particular for _Large Language Models_ (LLMs). It is intended for scientists who have been living under a rock (or in the lab) for the last months, and who want to learn the basics about AI stuff.

## The first problem: there is too much noise

Too many AI tools have spawned in the last months, but only a few seem useful for our academic duties. Here we will only focus on the most useful ones.

## The rest of the problems

**AI tools are not magic.**  

Please be cautious with AI-generated results. LLMs will always answer, yet sometimes they will not know anything about the subject and answer anyway. You need to think critically and verify that the information is correct. These models also have biases in their training data, so be careful.  

**AI tools should be viewed as a complementary tool rather than a replacements for your intelligence.**

## What can we use LLMs for?

The most interesting use cases for scientific research are:  

* **Learning** and understanding new concepts.  
* Accelerating **writing** and literature **review**.  
* Writing better computer **code**.

# Summary of The Cool Tools 😎  

## Main ways to access LLMs  
* [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). It is useful, but it is NOT connected to the internet, so do NOT trust references from him, he is lying.  
* [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/chat). It DOES give you references, it is REALLY USEFUL to search for any kind of info. It uses a more powerful model than the free version of ChatGPT.
Only works on _Microsoft Edge_, but you can install a plugin called _Bing Chat for All Browsers_ to use it on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bing-chat-for-all-browser/jofbglonpbndadajbafmmaklbfbkggpo) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bing-chat-for-all-browsers/).  
* [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). A VSCode plugin that helps you write code, the best code completion tool currently available, free with the university account.
* [HuggingChat](https://huggingface.co/chat/). The open source LLMs will probably appear here, those are still on production but expect major improvements in the coming months.  
* [Google Bard](https://bard.google.com/). Not yet available in Europe, but kind of like _Bing Chat_.

## To find papers and references
Upload a DOI and get many papers related to it:
* [Inciteful](https://inciteful.xyz/), using cross citations.  
* [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/), using AI to find related papers.  

## To help you write
* [Pix2Tex](https://p2t.behye.com/). Write $\LaTeX$ equations by uploading a screenshot.     
* [Deepl Write](https://www.deepl.com/write). Check your grammar or translate, really useful even for scientific texts.  
* [Google Reverse Image Search](https://images.google.com/). It is not new at all, but it is really useful to find the source of that graph that you don't know where it came from.  

## Other AI tools that may be useful
* [Ora.AI]([ora.ai](https://ora.ai)). You can tune the chat to answer very specific questions.  
* [Consensus](https://consensus.app/search/). Ask a yes or no question, and will try to answer according to the scientific literature.  
* [Explain Paper](https://www.explainpaper.com/). Upload a paper and mark sections of text that you do not understand, it will try to explain them in a simpler way.

# Use examples:

## ChatGPT

`I am a physicist, performing my master thesis on a scientific research group. The group leader asked me to give a small talk of around 15 minutes to the group members, about ChatGPT and other new AI tools that are currently emerging, such as bing chat, deepl, etc. I want to talk about the benefits of AI use in academic research: how can it be used for learning and understanding new concepts, to write proposals faster, to code faster, etc. Also about the risks: sometimes, results such as citations or mathematical calculations may be invented, and the scientist should learn when can a result be trusted. I want you to give me a possible outline of the talk. It should be very brief, remember that the talk can't be longer than 15 minutes. Think about the thematics that I proposed you, and add any other topics that may be relevant.`

# Use Cases and limitations for AI in Academia



# How to use Large Language Models (LLM) for Scientists Living Under a Rock (SLUR)

## Be Specific
ChatGPT is a tool that can be used to generate text. It relies on the given context to generate the next word. It is a very powerful tool that can be used as an assistant to get things explained, 

## Train the inputs
It will rarely give you what you want at first. It particularly excells if you ask it to review its previous output, checking for any possible mistakes, and then ask it to continue from there. It will often give you a more coherent response.




juanjo:

Básicamente ser muy específico

Entrenar los inputs, porque al principio nunca te da lo que quieres

Paciencia porque el tamaño de ventana es limitado y de momento Chatgpt tiene poca memoria (4092 bloques si no recuerdo mal)

Y es útil para algunas cosas pero no es dios

No te va a dar un paper, pero sí te quita síndrome de página en blanco

Da ideas chulas, pero eres tú el que determina

Escribe Código pero a veces con fallos

Es herramienta para facilitar el trabajo, no para hacerlo

Funciona muy bien también para escribir en inglés, mete expresiones nativas bastante bien
